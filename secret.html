    <h1>Secrets</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        ðŸ’¡ Keep Building : Every project you create adds to your portfolio and
        makes you a stronger developer.
      </li>
      <li>
        ðŸš€ Keep Learning : Stay curious, explore new technologies, and keep
        sharpening your skills.
      </li>
      <li>
        ðŸ”¥ Keep Pushing : Success isnâ€™t about how many times you fail but how
        many times you rise.

        1. Your CGPA â‰  Your Future The tech industry values skills over scores.
        Many companies donâ€™t even ask for your CGPA; they care about what you
        build, solve, and create. ðŸ”¥ Mark Zuckerberg didnâ€™t have a CGPA that
        defined him. He had a skill that changed the world!
      </li>
      <li>
        2. Every Day You Code, You Get Stronger Each line of code, each bug you
        fix, and each new concept you learn makes you better than yesterday.
        Progress may feel slow, but it compounds over time. ðŸ’¡ "Success is the
        sum of small efforts, repeated day in and day out." â€“ Robert Collier
      </li>
      <li>
        3. Challenges Are Your Stepping Stones Failures and rejections? They are
        part of the journey. Every rejection teaches you something. Every
        failure brings you one step closer to a breakthrough. ðŸ’ª "I have not
        failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work." â€“ Thomas Edison
      </li>
      <li>
        4. Just One Opportunity Can Change Your Life You donâ€™t need 100 jobs,
        just one right opportunity. Keep applying, keep networking, keep
        improving your portfolio. ðŸš€ Someone out there is looking for a
        developer just like youâ€”donâ€™t stop until you find them!
      </li>
      <li>Let's go! ðŸš€ðŸ’ªðŸ”¥</li>
